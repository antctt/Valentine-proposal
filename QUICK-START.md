# ✅ Ready for Vercel Deployment!

## What Was Fixed

Your Valentine proposal is now **100% ready** to deploy to Vercel! Here's what was done:

### 🐛 Bug Fixed
- **Audio file reference**: Changed `Minions Cheering.mp3` to `Minions Cheering.mp4` in script.js (the file was always .mp4, the code had the wrong extension)

### 📦 Files Added
1. **vercel.json** - Configures Vercel to deploy as a static site
2. **.vercelignore** - Excludes unnecessary files from deployment
3. **DEPLOYMENT.md** - Complete step-by-step deployment guide (mobile-friendly!)

## 🚀 What to Do Next

**Read the complete guide**: Open `DEPLOYMENT.md` for detailed instructions

**Quick Start** (from your phone):

1. Go to **https://vercel.com**
2. Sign up with GitHub
3. Import the **Valentine-proposal** repository
4. Click **Deploy**
5. Get your live URL!

That's it! No CLI needed. 📱
